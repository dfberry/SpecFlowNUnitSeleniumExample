Required Additional libraries/tools:
.FireFox - used both to capture Selenium tests and used by Selenium to run tests
.Specflow - full install
.NUnit - full install
.Selenium - webdriver and ide, nuget didn't have support dll

This Windows Visual Studio 2010 solution contains 3 class library projects. 
.Calculator library
.Calculator.spec specifications
.MVCCalculator mvc .net csharp website

I couldn't get this to run from inside Visual Studio but it does run the test from NUnit. 

Assuming you could build the solution, here is how to run the tests:
. open NUnit IDE (do not try to run inside Visual Studio)
. in NUnit, "File -> Open Project" and select the Calculator.spec.dll file. The NUnit ide should show the tests it found in the left column.
. in NUnit, "Run" in the top right column. 
. FireFox opens and test runs, FireFox closes.
. in NUnit, review test results.


[Note to Self: 

. Hit this interop compiler issue: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/8156488/what-does-reference-was-created-to-embedded-interop-assembly-mean

. Port number hardcoded into Calculator.spec/StepDefinition1.cs as 53113

.code has a bug on purpose
