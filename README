Required Additional libraries/tools:
.FireFox - used both to capture Selenium tests and used by Selenium to run tests
.Specflow - full install
.NUnit - full install
.Selenium - webdriver and ide, nuget didn't have support dll
.Java - Selenium uses java server

This Windows Visual Studio 2010 solution contains 3 class library projects. 
.Calculator library
.Calculator.spec specifications
.MVCCalculator mvc .net csharp website

I couldn't get this to run from inside Visual Studio but it does run the test from NUnit. 

Assuming you could build the solution, here is how to run the tests:
1. make sure selenium server it up and running, from command prompt: "java -jar selenium-server-standalone-2.20.0.jar"
2. open NUnit IDE (do not try to run inside Visual Studio)
3. in NUnit, "File -> Open Project" and select the Calculator.spec.dll file. The NUnit ide should show the tests it found in the left column.
4. in NUnit, "Run" in the top right column. 
5. FireFox opens and test runs, FireFox closes.
6. in NUnit, review test results.
