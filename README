Required Additional libraries/tools:
.Specflow
.NUnit
.Selenium

This Windows Visual Studio 2010 solution contains 3 class library projects. 
.Calculator library
.Calculator.spec specifications
.MVCCalculator mvc .net csharp website

I couldn't get this to run from inside Visual Studio but it does run the test from NUnit. 


[Note to Self:

. Port number hardcoded into Calculator.spec/StepDefinition1.cs as 53113
